    <h2>4. Household Finances and Payments</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Expense Splitting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>YurUp provides tools to calculate shared expenses. All debt balances shown in the App are calculations based

    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The YurUp App, its original content, UI designs, specific features (like Household Court and the Tidy AI
        implementation), and functionality are owned by us and protected by intellectual property laws. You may not
        copy, modify, or distribute any part of the App without written permission.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App integrates with third-party services including, but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> Payment processing and identity verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Plaid:</strong> Bank account connectivity.</li>

    <p>Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or perfectly accurate in every financial
        calculation. YurUp acts as a ledger and communication tool; we are not legally party to the debts accumulated
        between housemates.</p>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YURUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF FUNDS DUE TO USER ERROR OR INTERPERSONAL HOUSEHOLD DISPUTES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF
        THE APP.</p>

    <h2>9. App Store Terms</h2>
    <p>If you download the App from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These Terms are between you and YurUp, not Apple or Google.</li>
        <li>Apple/Google have no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the App.</li>
        <li>They are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them against you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Account and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your account and personal data at any time via the in-app "Delete
        Account" settings screen, or by contacting our Support email. If you delete your account, your personal profile
        data will be purged, though anonymized financial receipts may be retained by your former household for
        accounting integrity.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes represents your
        acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
