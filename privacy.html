<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>

<h3>Within Our Platform</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Household Members:</strong> Information you share in the App (such as your name, avatar, chores, expenses, messages, and court case details) is visible to other members of your active household group.</li>
  <li><strong>Parents/Caregivers:</strong> In Family mode, Parents or Caregivers have extended visibility over Child and Teen accounts, including spending requests and chore verifications.</li>
